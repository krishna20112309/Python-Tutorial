What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Variables in Python
* Variable doesn't start with numeric value
* id(a) will give the memory location of variable a
* if value of variable are same then id will be also same

String in Python
* In string + work as concatination
* during concationation both side will be string


Operators in Python
1. Arithmnetic Operator
   
   Operator        Name        Example
   +              Addition       x+y
   -              Substraction   x-y
   *            Multiplication   X*Y
   /            Division         x/y
   %            Modulus          x%y
   **           Exponents        x**y
   //           Floor division   x//y



2. Assignment Operator
   Operator      Example        Same AS
   =              x=5            x=5
   +=             x+=3          x=x+3
   -=            x-=3           x=x-3

3. Comparision Operators
   Operators     Name            Example
   ==           Equal            x==y
   !=           Not Equal        x!=y
   >           Greater Than      x>y
   <           Less than         x<y
   >=       Greater than or equal to  x>=y
   <=       Less than or equal to  x<=y

4. Logical Operators
    Operator            Description                                             Example
    and      return true if both statements are true                         x<5 and x<10
    or       returns true if one of the statements is true                    x<5 or x<10
    not      reverse the result, returns false if the result is true        not(x<5 and x<10)
